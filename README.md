## A Memoir of a Life Lived

### Manifesto

I have been told in no uncertain terms by society and everyone alike that writing a book on my family was a no no. That disclosing what I’ve lived would not be validated, even though, I know it could be valuable if not for anyone else, for me.

This is writing that comes deep from within, that makes me wrestle with all of the questions I otherwise dare not ask. It is the book I have always wanted to write. The one that speaks compassionately and honestly about the life I have lived, written from the perspective of self-acceptance and perhaps as a path to human dignity for all. 

My goals are, above all, honesty and to create the kind of work that moves me, and anyone who reads it, to open their eyes a little more. This will not be a work of venting, it will be a work of soul-making for myself and for all who read it.

As it is a matter of the heart, I will aim to write 200 words per day until it feels done.


## Chapter 1 : Murky Waters

I wake up to a dream, I am somewhere underwater, its a dark, murky green, full of odd plant life flailing around me, brushing my bare legs as if to grip them and pull them further in although I cannot see much beyond my hands. Suddenly, I feel something or someone tug at me, grab my leg and with brute force, inject my upper thigh. 

I don’t feel much after that and next thing I know, I am standing by myself at the drivers seat of an old tractor, sopping wet, clumsily putting my underwear on while telling myself a story, like kids do. I don’t recall the story. I do recall it. I was regañado a un niño, an imaginary little boy, one who had done some thing very wrong. Suddently, I look up from what I'm doing and there, watching me from behind is my grandpa; watching me like he watched me in the shower, and in the bedroom we shared nightly, while my grandmother slept in the hall.

I was six years old, maybe seven. I had gone from a slim child to looking more like a little barrel in the half a year my mother had moved me into my grandparents house. A farm house, farm country. One hour from Hermosillo, Son. Mexico. Where we were born, my mother and I. My brother, too. My sister, having been the first one and a sort of unplanned, planned surprise - at to least my father, if we have the same father, which we may never know - was born in Mexico City; where my mother was working selling clothes out of her car or working for the Mexican lottery. Not sure since we were never given too many details.  
 
What I know is that my mother was in the United States of America at the time of this particular event. She was following a dream, her dream. She had joined some club where her picture appeared in papers. And, the last time I spoke with her she had been really excited about a man who was from some place where it was beautiful and where it snowed. He had a son, Bruce, who was 19; all grown up and I fantasized about marrying him. She said he was rich and had come to visit her in Arizona. I think he conducted the symphony somewhere in California. Tahoe or san francisco or... I didn’t know all of the details. I remember these because she repeated them excitedly over and over again, as if that made them or some dream come true. She said his name as if it were honey rolling off her tongue: Beel Khamerun. Beel Khamerun. Beel. Beel Khamerun. Mr. Beel Khamerun. She would say repeatedly, with her heavy Mexican accent and cocoine lathed voice, with the depth of Barry White. 

My mother was good looking and the rule at home was you didn’t have to eat at meal time because there was always a bowl of fruit on the table if you got hungry. One of my first family memories is of going to an all-natural convent retreat with the Monjas – the nun's compound in the outskirts of Guadalajara, where we lived before and after my father’s sudden, though not all together a surprise to some, death in a car accident. It’s how we survived, or rather, how my mother made sure we survived.  We'll get to that. This retreat was a weekender. 3 days of fasting. We could not have been more than ages 5,4,3. We were young. She was young, in her late 30’s. She had me in 1980, which if correct, would have put her at 36 or 37. So...early 40’s.  

I am the middle child.  

What I remember vividly about this retreat, other than the concrete beds, soft terra ground on which we walked barefooted and the utter feeling of starvation for the length of our stay, was the treat at the end; a baked apple!  
...divine... 
Oh goodness how we lived for it. I guess we must have done these retreats more than once. I don’t much remember, but then I do.  
I also remember my mother leaving us alone at home in Guadalajara. Often. Once she drove to Nuevo Leon, where she said she stocked up on merch at wholesale prices to sell to her friends. In order to sell more clothes, we all modeled, meaning that by sheer need to make money (or so I thought) we had to stay skinny and be pretty and behave exactly as she would have had us behave all.the.time. – this led to a lot of disappointment and, well, uglyness let's just say. 

For me it was day, to day being. It wasn’t like she was a monster or an abuser. She was our mother and our mother was to be listened to or hell would come down on you. And, that meant anything from physical abuse in the form of slapping across the face to knocking you down by slamming the door in your face, or kicking you with heels on while facing away from you without looking back to see where the heel would land, or using you for her pleasures, whatever those might be in the moment. 
 
It (must not have been) wasn’t easy being a single mother of 3, or a widow so young and full of desires for a life that could not be. We were expected to work towards this life she could never give herself until the day we died so that she might glimpse it or take it from us if possible and oh, it was always possible because she owned us. We were clear about that. 

Some things were more painful than others. One, I remember like it was yesterday.  
Our father had been killed in an accident while driving across a bridge, a car full of co-workers and he died. He was driving. A few months passed, we moved from our family home, 2 floors, beautiful stairs which I loved; to the small, 1 bedroom studio size apartment at the corner of the same street. Now, homes do not come easily in Mexico, mostly because people don’t so much move as they do expand properties as the family grows. Nonetheless, there we were, in a new apartment like home, sharing a large bed or a bed large enough for the 4 of us. This thousands of miles away from extended family, in Guadalajara, Jalisco.

My mother left us unattended because she felt she had no other choice. All of the helpers she hired left as soon as they arrived. Stating that we were unruly, and it was impossible to work with us, or that’s what we heard her tell all of our family, and anyone who cared to ask or not ask. 

Once, shortly after my father'd death, she had been out doing what she did, whatever that was. When she returned, the house was not in the state she must have expected it to be, because following a rampage of hurricance katrina level warnings and disastrous hurling, she suddenly dropped on our kitchen/livingroom floor. Face up and unresponsive to our crying, screaming and begging of her to come back. If you come back I’ll be good, I promise! Wailing....For how long who knows, this went on. Until she felt venerated sufficiently I suppose. Then, miraculously she returned to life. Reminding us to remember what we had just said to jesus christ and the promises that we made so that we would never again be bad, never again. From that day on, I was the perfect little one. Tending to anything she needed. Foot rubs, back rubs, rubs of any kind, drinks, food. Later it meant taking care of the other 2 children emotionally and physically until my 30s; when after a long time of suffering and considering it, I decided to make a break for it. And, that was the beginning of a new end. The beginning of a new life which shone light on things I had not seen, I did not want to see, I did not dare to look at for a long, long time.
