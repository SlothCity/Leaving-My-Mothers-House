## Leaving My Mother's House
A Memoir of a life lived


### Manifesto

I am writing the book I have always wanted to write. The one that speaks compassionately and honestly about the life I have lived. From the perspective of self-acceptance and perhaps as a path to human dignity for all. Whatever that means. 

I am using I a lot, because I am writing it. It can be changed later, reworded etc. No editing will happen as I am writing my truth. My passionate truth. Fucks and all. This will not be a work of venting, it will be a work of soul-making for myself and for all who read it.
