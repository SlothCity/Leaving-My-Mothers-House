## A Memoir of a life lived

### Manifesto

I have been told in no uncertain terms by society and everyone alike that writing a book on my mother was a no no. That disclosing what Iâ€™ve lived would not be validated, even though, I know it could be valuable if not for anyone else, for me.

This is writing that comes deep from within, that makes me wrestle with all of the questions I otherwise dare not ask. It is the book I have always wanted to write. The one that speaks compassionately and honestly about the life I have lived, written from the perspective of self-acceptance and perhaps as a path to human dignity for all. 

My goals are honesty, above all, and to create the kind of work that moves me, and anyone who reads it, to open their eyes a little more. This will not be a work of venting, it will be a work of soul-making for myself and for all who read it.
