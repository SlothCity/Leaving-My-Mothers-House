## Leaving My Mother's House
A Memoir of a life lived


### Manifesto

I am writing the book I have always wanted to write. The one that speaks compassionately and honestly about the life I have lived. Its written from the perspective of self-acceptance and perhaps as a path to human dignity for all. Whatever that means. 

I am using I a lot, because I am writing it. It can be changed later, reworded etc. No editing will happen as I am writing my truth. My passionate truth. Fucks and all. This will not be a work of venting, it will be a work of soul-making for myself and for all who read it.

My goals are honesty, above all; and to create the kind of work that moves me and anyone who reads it to open their eyes a little more.

This is writing that comes from deep within, that makes me wrestle with all of the questions within myself, ones that I dare not ask. 

I have been told in no uncertain terms by society and everyone alike that writing a book on my mother was a no no. That disclosing what Iâ€™ve lived would not be validated, even though, I know it could be valuable if not for anyone else, for me. And that, my friends, is good enough.
