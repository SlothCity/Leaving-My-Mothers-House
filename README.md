## A Memoir of a life lived

### Manifesto

I have been told in no uncertain terms by society and everyone alike that writing a book on my mother was a no no. That disclosing what I’ve lived would not be validated, even though, I know it could be valuable if not for anyone else, for me.

This is writing that comes deep from within, that makes me wrestle with all of the questions I otherwise dare not ask. It is the book I have always wanted to write. The one that speaks compassionately and honestly about the life I have lived, written from the perspective of self-acceptance and perhaps as a path to human dignity for all. 

My goals are honesty, above all, and to create the kind of work that moves me, and anyone who reads it, to open their eyes a little more. This will not be a work of venting, it will be a work of soul-making for myself and for all who read it.


## Chapter 1 : Murky Waters

I wake up to a dream, I am somewhere underwater, its a dark, murky green, full of odd plant life flailing around me, brushing my bare legs as if to grip them and pull them further in although I cannot see much beyond my hands. Suddenly, I feel something or someone tug at me, grab my leg and with brute force, inject my upper thigh. 

I don’t feel much after that and next thing I know, I am standing by myself at the drivers seat of an old tractor, sopping wet, clumsily putting my underwear on while telling myself a story, like kids do. I don’t recall the story. I do recall it. I was regañado a un niño, an imaginary little boy, one who had done some thing very wrong. Suddently, I look up from what I'm doing and there, watching me from behind is my grandpa; watching me like he watched me in the shower, in the bedroom we shared nightly, while my grandmother slept in the hall.

I was six years old, maybe seven. I had gone from a slim child, to looking more like a little barrel in the half a year my mother had moved me into my grandparents house. A farm house, farm country. One hour from the main city of Hermosillo, Son. Mexico. Where we were born, my mother and I. My brother, too. My sister, having been the first one and a sort of unplanned, planned surprise - at to least my father, if we have the same father, which we may never know - was born in Mexico City; where my mother was working selling clothes out of her car or working for the Mexican lottery. Not sure since we were never given too many details.  

What I know is that my mother was in the United States of America at this time. Following a dream. She had joined some club where her picture appeared in the papers. And, the last time I spoke with her she had been really excited about a man who was from some place where it was beautiful and where it snowed. He had a son, Bruce, who was 19; all grown up and I fantasized about marrying him. She said he was rich and had come to visit her in Arizona. I think he conducted the symphony somewhere in California. Tahoe or san francisco or... I didn’t know all of the details. I remember these because she repeated them excitedly over and over again, as if that made them or some dream come true. She said his name as if it were honey rolling off her tongue: Beel Khamerun. Beel Khamerun. Beel. Beel Khamerun. Mr. Beel Khamerun. She would say repeatedly, with her heavy Mexican accent and cocoine lathed voice, the depth of barry white. 

My mother was good looking and the rule at home was you didn’t have to eat at meal time because there was always a bowl of fruit on the table if you got hungry. One of my first family memories is of going to an all-natural convent retreat with the Monjas – the nun's compound in the outskirts of Guadalajara, where we lived before and after my father’s sudden, though not all together unbeknown to some, death in a car accident. It’s how we survived, or rather, how my mother made sure we survived.  We'll get to that. This retreat was a weekender. 3 days of fasting. We could not have been more than ages 5,4,3. We were young. She was young, in her late 30’s. She had me in 1980, which if correct, would have put her at 36 or 37. So...early 40’s.  

I am the middle child.  

What I remember vividly about this retreat, other than the concrete beds, soft terra ground on which we walked barefooted and the utter feeling of starvation for the length of our stay, was the treat at the end; a baked apple!  
...divine... 
Oh goodness how we lived for it. I guess we must have done these retreats more than once. I don’t much remember, but then I do.  
I also remember my mother leaving us alone at home in Guadalajara. Often. Once she drove to Nuevo Leon, where she said she bought all of her stock wholesale to sell to her friends. In order to sell more clothes, we all modeled, meaning that by sheer need to make money (or so I thought) we had to stay skinny and be pretty and behave exactly as she would have had us behave all.the.time. – this led to a lot of disappointment and, well, uglyness let's just say.
