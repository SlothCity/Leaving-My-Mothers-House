## A Memoir of a life lived

### Manifesto

I have been told in no uncertain terms by society and everyone alike that writing a book on my mother was a no no. That disclosing what I’ve lived would not be validated, even though, I know it could be valuable if not for anyone else, for me.

This is writing that comes deep from within, that makes me wrestle with all of the questions I otherwise dare not ask. It is the book I have always wanted to write. The one that speaks compassionately and honestly about the life I have lived, written from the perspective of self-acceptance and perhaps as a path to human dignity for all. 

My goals are honesty, above all, and to create the kind of work that moves me, and anyone who reads it, to open their eyes a little more. This will not be a work of venting, it will be a work of soul-making for myself and for all who read it.


## Chapter 1 : Murky Waters

I wake up to a dream where I am somewhere underwater, the water is dark green, full of odd plant life flailing around me, brushing my bare legs as if to grip them and pull them further in. Its murky and I cannot see much beyond my hands. Suddenly, I feel something or someone tug at me, grab my leg and with brute force, and inject my upper thigh. 

I don’t feel much after that and next thing I know, I am standing by myself, at the drivers seat of an old tractor, sopping wet putting my underwear on while telling myself a story, like kids do. I don’t recall the story. I do recall it. I was regañado a un niño,a little boy, one who had done some thing wrong. 

I was six years old, maybe seven. I had gone from a slim child, to looking more like a little barrel in the half a year my mother had moved me into my grandparents house. A farm house, farm country. One hour from the main city of Hermosillo, Son. Mexico. Where we were born, my mother and I. My brother, too. My sister, having been the first one and a sort of unplanned, planned surprise to at least my father, if we have the same father, which we may never know, was born in Mexico City; where my mother was working selling clothes out of her car or working for the Mexican lottery. Not sure since we were never given too many details.
