## A Memoir of a Life Lived

### Manifesto

I have been told in no uncertain terms by society and everyone alike that writing a book on my family was a no no. That disclosing what I’ve lived would not be validated, even though, I know it could be valuable if not for anyone else, for me.

This is writing that comes deep from within, that makes me wrestle with all of the questions I otherwise dare not ask. It is the book I have always wanted to write. The one that speaks compassionately and honestly about the life I have lived, written from the perspective of self-acceptance and perhaps as a path to human dignity for all. 

My goals are, above all, honesty and to create the kind of work that moves me, and anyone who reads it, to open their eyes a little more. This will not be a work of venting, it will be a work of soul-making for myself and for all who read it.

As it is a matter of the heart, I will aim to write 200 words per day until it feels done.


## Chapter 1 : Murky Waters

I wake up to a dream, I am somewhere underwater, its a dark, murky green, full of odd plant life flailing around me, brushing my bare legs as if to grip them and pull them further in although I cannot see much beyond my hands. Suddenly, I feel something or someone tug at me, grab my leg and with brute force, inject my upper thigh. 

I don’t feel much after that and next thing I know, I am standing by myself at the drivers seat of an old tractor, sopping wet, clumsily putting my underwear on while telling myself a story, like kids do. I don’t recall the story. I do recall it. I was regañado a un niño, an imaginary little boy, one who had done some thing very wrong. Suddently, I look up from what I'm doing and there, watching me from behind is my grandpa; watching me like he watched me in the shower, and in the bedroom we shared nightly, while my grandmother slept in the hall.

I was six years old, maybe seven. I had gone from a slim child to looking more like a little barrel in the half a year my mother had moved me into my grandparents house. A farm house, farm country. One hour from Hermosillo, Son. Mexico. Where we were born, my mother and I. My brother, too. My sister, having been the first one and a sort of unplanned, planned surprise - at to least my father, if we have the same father, which we may never know - was born in Mexico City; where my mother was working selling clothes out of her car or working for the Mexican lottery. Not sure since we were never given too many details.  
 
What I know is that my mother was in the United States of America at the time of this particular event. She was following a dream, her dream. She had joined some club where her picture appeared in papers. And, the last time I had spoken with her she was really excited about a man who was from some place where it was beautiful and where it snowed. He had a son, Bruce, who was 19; all grown up and I fantasized about marrying him. She said Beel was rich and had come to visit her in Arizona. I think he conducted the symphony somewhere in California. Tahoe or san francisco or... I didn’t know all of the details. I remember these because she repeated them excitedly over and over again, as if that made them or some dream come true. She said his name as if it were chunky honey attempting to roll off her tongue: Beel Khamerun. Beel Khamerun. Beel. Beel Khamerun. Mr. Beel Khamerun. She would say repeatedly, with her heavy Mexican accent and cocoine lathed voice, with the depth of Barry White. 

My mother was good looking and the rule at home was you didn’t have to eat at meal time, or at any time really, because there was always a bowl of fruit on the table if you got hungry. One of my first family memories is of going to an all-natural convent retreat with the Monjas – the nun's compound in the outskirts of Guadalajara, where we lived before and after my father’s sudden, though not all together a surprise to some, death in a car accident. It’s how we survived, or rather, how my mother made sure we survived.  We'll get to that. This retreat was a weekender. 3 days of fasting. We could not have been more than ages 5,4,3. We were young. She was young, in her late 30’s. She had me in 1980, which if correct, would have put her at 36 or 37. So...early 40’s.  

I am the middle child.  

What I remember vividly about this retreat, other than the concrete beds, soft terra ground on which we walked barefooted, and the demoralizing constant feeling of starvation for the length of our stay, was the treat at the end; a baked cinnamon apple!  

...how divine... Oh goodness how we lived for it. I guess we must have done these retreats more than once. I don’t much remember, but then I do.  
I also remember my mother leaving us alone at home in Guadalajara. Often. Once she drove to Nuevo Leon, where she said she stocked up on merch at wholesale prices to sell to her friends. In order to sell more clothes, we all modeled, meaning that by sheer need to make money (or so I thought) we had to stay skinny and be pretty and behave exactly as she would have had us behave all.the.time. – this led to a lot of disappointment and, well, uglyness let's just say. 

For me it was day to day living. It wasn’t like she was a monster or an abuser. She was our mother and our mother was to be listened to or hell would come down on you. And that meant anything from physical abuse in the form of slapping across the face to knocking you down by slamming the door in your face, or kicking you with heels on while facing away from you without looking back to see where the heel would land, or using you for her pleasures, whatever those might be in the moment. 
 
It (must not have been) wasn’t easy being a single mother of 3, or a widow so young and full of desires for a life that could not be. We were expected to work towards this life she could never give herself until the day we died so that she might glimpse it or take it from us if possible and oh, it was always possible because she owned us. We were clear about that.  

In any case, Beel khamerun or Bill Cameron never made it into the family picture, he said he was interested in living his life, not raising her kids.

Some memories are more poignant than others. One, I remember like it was yesterday.
Our father had been killed in an accident while driving across a bridge, a car full of co-workers and he died. He was drinking and driving, as usual. A few months passed, we moved from our family home, 2 floors, beautiful stairs which I loved; to the small, 1 bedroom studio size apartment at the corner of the same street. Now, homes do not come easily in Mexico, mostly because people don’t so much move as they do expand properties as the family grows. Nonetheless there we were, in an apartment, sharing a large bed or a bed large enough for the 4 of us. This, thousands of miles away from extended family.

My mother left us unattended because she felt she had no other choice. All of the helpers she hired left as soon as they arrived. Complaining that we were unruly, and it was impossible to work with us, or that’s what we heard her tell all of our family, and anyone who cared to ask or not ask. 

We were never to go to the doctor unless there was a serious threat to our life. She expressed how horrible doctors were, how they didn't know what they were doing, how they were poisoning people and it was bad medicine. Instead she took us to curanderos who prescribed herbs, did chiropractor work on our bodies and said prayers over our souls. She claimed our problems were psychological and they agreed with her. 

Once, shortly after my father's death, she had been out doing what she did, whatever that was. When she returned, the house was not in the state she must have expected it to be, because following a rampage of hurricance katrina level attacks and disastrous hurling, she suddenly dropped on our kitchen/livingroom floor. Face up and unresponsive to our crying, screaming and begging of her to come back. "If you come back I’ll be good, I promise!" Wailing....For how long who knows, this went on. Until she felt venerated sufficiently I suppose. Then, miraculously she returned to life. Reminding us to remember what we had just said to Jesus Christ and the promises that we made so that we would never again be bad, never again. From that day on, I was the perfect little one, I had to be. Tending to anything she needed; foot rubs, back rubs, rubs of any kind, drinks, food, housekeeping, you name it. Later it meant taking care of the other 2 children emotionally and physically until my 30s; when after a long time of suffering while considering it, I decided to make a break for it. And that was the beginning of a new end. The beginning of a new life which shone light on things I had not seen, I did not want to see, I did not dare to look at for a long, long time.

## The Missing Years

## The Color Purple

I read the color purple once and had an epiphany of sorts. There was also the Greek temple story, in which women devirginized each other using a wooden (perhaps) phallis. It was a ritual, a sacred, humane way to enter the world of sexuality for women. Then there was the Antwone Fischer, the man who was abused by a woman in his life and after that movie I bawled. I understood something then and there and could not place it. I went crazy almost and almost had myself committed during that time. It was all coming up, surging up and I could no longer contain it. This was in my early 20’s. This was when I turned to alcohol.

I felt much the same, I think, when I came upon the organization (operation) underground railroad a year or so ago. I’m now 40. All the film shorts I watched, they all resonated. I knew then what it was, it was more than starting to take shape, it was developing into my own set of shorts of memories from over the years. And it is happening again. I get shorts.  

I remember the time I was at the Landmark forum in my mid 20’s,my mother had urged me to go to solve my emotional problems. We were asked to go deep, and deep I went, in to a sort of memory rewind trance. I suddenly felt the attack, many hands holding me down, and getting ready to do something terrible to me. I did not know what was happening. The "professor" came over to me knelt and very quickly assessed and spoke out loud the situation. In front of 200 people he asked, "were you abused sexually?" "Yes," I said. And that was the end of it. I never really touched it again after that. Not for a long time.  

I remember mom apologizing in an agony that could only be described as overtaken with guilt. "I am so sorry for what I did, Mija. I am so sorry for what I did. I am sorry I left you in Mexico." Over and over, over the years. I was quick to absolve her and tell her I had learned from the experience of the sexual abuse by Grandpa, but she would not let up. This came every once in a while. I don’t remember the pattern of it all, I do remember from time to time she would collapse and throw up and sleep for days. I had to tend to her. Someone labeled it hypoglycemia. I can say I have had something similar. Terrible headaches that lead to nausea and throwing up, they lasted until one day it became apparent that if I could be with the pain, all of it and see that there was so much emotion, memory and hurt behind it, the physical manifestation subsided. And, that was not easy. The headaches are trecherous and all I want to do was to take strong pain killers. They are almost as trecherous as the memories, which I think started arising with clarity around the time the headaches began, when all of these symptoms came. The same or similar symptoms my mother was taken over by all the years. Perhaps still.  

For a long time I thought the terrible member...memory of being held down and screaming happened at the farm. Maybe it did. Maybe she knew that I would be terrifyingly abused then – perhaps in an effort to blame something other than herself for the tragedies she committed against her children, maybe just against me, she would then have a perpetrator other than herself to point to.  

I remember the ice baths. She would tell us that they were used after giving birth, to heal the vagina. But then, why were we in ice baths (ages 3,4 and on)? She claimed it killed worms and other bad things. What was she really healing and why was I constantly in the doctors office for vaginal infections, pain during urination, etc at such young ages? And, why was I seeing only one doctor, whom she claimed was an uncle. Was he? I think the family knew him. He lives in rocky point from what I can remember(tio Jaime) . When I watched Sybil I sort of dissociated, yet the scene when the lady lays her down and tells her its time for her vaginal wash, I flinched and shut down completely. There is something there that I cannot (yet) explain.  

The torture movie of the woman held against her will and eyes, hands feet sown together and fed and tortured until unrecognizable. That trended. Psychologically I felt like her. The dream I had, of the girl who sowed a horse's head to hers, and many things from the dump along with it – there were memories coalescing. Still, I do not see a clear picture. 

The difference from then to now, is that I am willing to see it. I am ready to be with all of my support and I am willing to see clearly what is there.  

The memories come up one by one then like lazy rain drops threatening a tornado. I remember once, several years ago, when I was scrolling through my facebook feed, out of NO where, a picture of a naked baby, on its back with a dick on its vagina. The imaged burned through my eyes, my mind, my heart and my soul. Waking up the uglyness that I never wanted to see manifested outside of me. It reminded me of the terror that I shut out within - but not for many many years to come would I own it - Of the memory of Gloria Trevi, who was once accused of sex trafficking children or at least accused of it. Who could ever do that? Who could ever do such things...to me?
 
Then, in TO when I was trying my best to get over a love like no other, as I was trying to expand my range of emotion, I searched for a psychological thriller. First came up the Playboy bunny mansion documentary, another one. After watching it, which in restrospect is quite a lineup and synchronistic connection, I came upon Mr. Robot. In the opening Episode, the main character Elliot hacks a coffee shop’s wifi, which turns out to be an underground pornography, ahem, child pornography operation. It fascinates me, torments me and reminds me of another...
