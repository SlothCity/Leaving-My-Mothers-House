## A Memoir of a Life Lived

### Manifesto

I have been told in no uncertain terms by society and everyone alike that writing a book on my family was a no no. That disclosing what I’ve lived would not be validated, even though, I know it could be valuable if not for anyone else, for me.

This is writing that comes deep from within, that makes me wrestle with all of the questions I otherwise dare not ask. It is the book I have always wanted to write. The one that speaks compassionately and honestly about the life I have lived, written from the perspective of self-acceptance and perhaps as a path to human dignity for all. 

My goals are, above all, honesty and to create the kind of work that moves me, and anyone who reads it, to open their eyes a little more. This will not be a work of venting, it will be a work of soul-making for myself and for all who read it.

As it is a matter of the heart, I will aim to write 200 words per day until it feels done.

Trigger warnings in effect.


## Chapter 1 : Murky Waters

I wake up to a dream, I am somewhere underwater, its a dark, murky green, full of odd plant life flailing around me, brushing my bare legs as if to grip them and pull them further in, although I cannot see much beyond my hands. Suddenly it happens, I feel something or someone tug at me, grab my leg and with brute force, inject my upper thigh. 

I don’t feel much after that and next thing I know, I am standing by myself at the drivers seat of an old tractor, sopping wet, clumsily putting my underwear on while telling myself a story, like kids do. I don’t recall the story. I do recall it. I was regañado a un niño, an imaginary little boy, one who had done some thing very wrong. Something magnetically calls my attention, I look up from what I'm doing and there, watching me from behind is my grandpa; watching me like he watched me in the shower, and in the bedroom we shared nightly, while my grandmother slept in the hall.

I was six years old, maybe seven. I had gone from a slim child to looking more like a little barrel in the half a year my mother had moved me into my grandparents house. A farm house, farm country. One hour from the capital, Hermosillo, Son. Mexico, where we were born, my mother and I. My brother, too. My sister, having been the first one and a sort of unplanned, planned surprise - at to least my father, if we have the same father, which we may never know - was born in Mexico City; where my mother was working selling clothes out of her car or working for the Mexican lottery. Not sure since we were never given too many details.  
 
What I know is that my mother was in the United States of America at the time of this particular event. She was following a dream, her dream while she worked as a housekeeping lady in the most posh hotel in Mesa, AZ, the Renaissance. She had joined a club where her picture appeared in papers. And, the last time I had spoken with her she was really excited about a man who was from some place where it was beautiful and where it snowed. He had a son, Bruce, who was 19; all grown up and I fantasized about marrying him. She said Beel was rich and had come to visit her in Arizona. I think he conducted the symphony somewhere in California. Tahoe or San Francisco or... I didn’t know all of the details. I remember these because she repeated them excitedly over and over again, as if that made them or some dream come true. She said his name as if it were sticking honey attempting to roll off her tongue: Beel Khamerun. Beel Khamerun. Beel. Beel Khamerun. Mr. Beel Khamerun. She would say repeatedly, with her heavy Mexican accent and cocoine lathed voice that had the depth of Barry White. 

One way or another, my mother found her way. She paid to be taken across the border into the United States, claiming to be a seasonal worker - picking oranges. She was more the heavy blue eyeshadow, Liz Taylor wannabe type than a fruit picker. Nonetheless, as with everything else, she made it work out in her favor. Something that's stuck with me all of these years, although I cannot say it had any merrit in my life for some time. 

Mom was good looking and the rule at home was you didn’t have to eat at meal time, or at any time really, because there was always a bowl of fruit on the table if you got hungry. One of my first family memories is of going to an all-natural convent retreat with the Monjas – a nunnery compound in the outskirts of Guadalajara, the city in which we lived before and after my father’s sudden, though not all together a surprise to some, death in a car accident. It’s how we survived, or rather, how my mother made sure we survived.  We'll get to that. This retreat was a weekender. 3 days of fasting. We could not have been more than ages 5,4,3. We were young. She was young, in her late 30’s. She had me in 1980, which if correct, would have put her at 36 or 37. No...early 40’s.  

I am the middle child.  

What I remember vividly about this retreat, other than the concrete beds, soft terra ground on which we walked barefooted, and the demoralizing constant feeling of starvation for the length of our stay, was the treat at the end; a baked cinnamon apple!  

...how divine... Oh goodness how we lived for it. I guess we must have done these retreats more than once. I don’t much remember, but then I do.  
I also remember my mother leaving us alone at home in Guadalajara. Often. Once she drove to Nuevo Leon, where she said she stocked up on merch at wholesale prices to sell to her friends. In order to sell more clothes, we all modeled, meaning that by sheer need to make money (or so I thought) we had to stay skinny and be pretty and behave exactly as she would have had us behave all.the.time. – this led to a lot of disappointment and, well, uglyness.

For me it was day to day living. It wasn’t like she was a monster or an abuser. She was our mother and our mother was to be listened to or hell would come down on you. And that meant anything from physical abuse in the form of slapping across the face to knocking you down by slamming the door in your face, or kicking you with heels on while facing away from you without looking back to see where the heel would land, or using you for her pleasures, whatever those might be in the moment. 
 
It (must not have been) wasn’t easy being a single mother of 3, or a widow so young and full of desires for a life that could not be hers. We were expected to work towards this life that she could never give herself until the day we died so that she might glimpse it or take it from us if possible and oh, it was always possible because she owned us. We were clear about that.  

In any case, Beel khamerun or Bill Cameron never made it into the family picture, he said he was interested in living his life, not raising her kids. He never met us and sadly for us, this was a constant reminder of how we got in the way of her and her life. This she made sure we we clear about on a regular basis.

Some memories are more poignant than others. One, I remember like it was yesterday.
Our father had been killed in an accident while driving across a bridge, a car full of co-workers and he died. He was drinking and driving, as usual. When we asked for him, mainly me as I was attached at the hip to my daddy, she said he had graduated. Daddy had reached the angels before anyone else! Weren't we proud? 

A few months passed, we moved from our family home, 2 floors, beautiful stairs which I loved; to the small, 1 bedroom studio size apartment at the corner of the same street. Now, homes do not come easily in Mexico, mostly because people don’t so much move as they do expand properties as the family grows. Nonetheless there we were, in an apartment, sharing a large bed or a bed large enough for the 4 of us. This, thousands of miles away from extended family in our hometown of Hermosillo.

My mother left us unattended because she felt she had no other choice. All of the helpers she hired left as soon as they arrived. Complaining that we were unruly, and it was impossible to work with us, or that’s what we heard her tell all of our family, and anyone who cared to ask or not ask. 

And another thing, we were never to go to the doctor unless there was a serious threat to our life. She told over and over how horrible doctors were, how they didn't know what they were doing, how they were poisoning people and it was bad medicine. Instead she took us to curanderos who prescribed herbs, did chiropractor work on our bodies and said prayers over our souls. She claimed our problems were psychological and they agreed with her. Maybe they were right.

Once, shortly after my father's death, she had been out doing what she did, whatever that was. When she returned, the house was not in the state she must have expected it to be, because following a rampage of hurricance katrina level attacks and disastrous hurling, she suddenly dropped on our kitchen/livingroom floor. Face up and unresponsive to our crying, screaming and begging of her to come back to us. "If you come back I’ll be good, I promise!" We wailed. For how long who knows, this went on. Until she felt venerated sufficiently I suppose. 

Then, miraculously she returned to life. Reminding us of what we had just promised to Jesus Christ, that we would never again be bad, never again or mammi would die, too. From that day on, I was the perfect little one, I had to be. Tending to anything she needed; foot rubs, back rubs, rubs of any kind, drinks, food, housekeeping, you name it. Later it meant taking care of the other 2 children emotionally and physically, which went on until my 30s; when after a long time of suffering, while considering it, I decided to make a break for it. And that was the beginning of a new end. The beginning of a new life which shone light on things I had not seen, I did not want to see, I did not dare to look at for a long, long time.

## The Missing Years

## The Color Purple

I read the color purple once and had an epiphany of sorts. There was also the Greek temple story, in which women devirginized each other using a wooden (perhaps) phallis. It was a ritual, a sacred, humane way to introduce the world of sexuality to girls becoming women. Then there was Antwone Fischer, the man who was abused by women in his family, after that movie I bawled. I understood something then and there and could not place it. I went crazy almost and almost had myself committed during that time. It was all coming up, surging up and I could no longer contain it. This was in my early 20’s. This was when I turned to alcohol.

I felt much the same, I think, when I came upon the organization (operation) underground railroad a year or so ago. I’m now 42. All the film shorts I watched, they all resonated. I knew then what it was, it was more than starting to take shape, it was developing into my own set of shorts of memories from over the years. And it is happening again. I get shorts.  

I remember the time I was at the Landmark forum in my mid 20’s,my mother had urged me to go to solve my emotional problems. We were asked to go deep, and deep I went, in to a sort of memory rewind trance. I suddenly felt the attack, many hands holding me down, and getting ready to do something terrible to me. I did not know what was happening. The "professor" came over to me knelt and very quickly assessed and spoke out loud the situation. In front of 200 people he asked, "were you abused sexually?" "Yes," I said. And that was the end of it. I never really touched it again after that. Not for a long time.  

I remember mom apologizing in an agony that could only be described as overtaken with guilt. “I am so sorry for what I did when you were little, Mija. I am so sorry for what I did. I am sorry I left you in Mexico.” Over and over, over the years. I was quick to absolve her and tell her I had learned from the experience of the sexual abuse by Grandpa, but she would not let up. This came every once in a while. I don’t remember the pattern of it all, I do remember from time to time she would collapse and throw up and sleep for days. I had to tend to her. Someone labeled it hypoglycemia. I can say I have had something similar. Terrible headaches that lead to nausea and throwing up, they lasted until one day it became apparent that if I could be with my pain, all of it and see that there was so much emotion, memory and hurt behind it, the physical manifestation subsided - And that was not easy. The headaches are treacherous and all I want to do every time was to take strong pain killers. They are almost as treacherous as the memories, which I think started arising with clarity around the time the headaches began, when all these symptoms came. The same or similar symptoms my mother was overtaken by all the years. Perhaps still.

For a long time I thought the terrible member…memory of being held down and screaming happened at the farm. Maybe it did. Maybe she knew that I would be terrifyingly abused then – perhaps in an effort to blame something other than herself for the tragedies she committed against her children, maybe just against me, she would then have a perpetrator other than herself to point to.

I remember the ice baths. She would tell us that they were used after giving birth, to heal the vagina. But then, why were we in ice baths (ages 3,4 and on)? She claimed it killed worms and other bad things. What was she really healing and why was I constantly in the doctor’s office for vaginal infections, pain during urination, etc. from such young age on? And why was I seeing only one doctor, whom she claimed was an uncle. Was he? I think the family knew him. He lives in rocky point from what I can remember. Tio Jaime, they called him. When I watched Sybil, I sort of dissociated, yet the scene when the lady lays her down, ties her up and tells her it’s time for her vaginal wash or something, I flinched and shut down completely. There is something there that I cannot (yet) explain.

The torture movie I once watched, of a woman held against her will in a barn. Her eyes, hands, feet sown together; hand fed and tortured until unrecognizable. That trended. Psychologically I felt like her. The dream I had the very night after I wrote this laSt sentence, of the girl who sowed a horse’s head to hers, and many things from the dump along with it claiming everything was Ok. "Everything is fine!." An attitude I had to take on to survive – these were memories coalescing. Still, I do not see a clear picture.

The difference from then to now, is that I am willing to see it. I am ready to be with all of my support and I am willing to see clearly what is there.
The memories come up one by one then, like lazy rain drops threatening a tornado. I remember once, several years ago, when I was scrolling through my facebook feed, out of NO where, a picture of a naked baby, on its back with a dick on its vagina. The imaged burned through my eyes, my mind, my heart and my soul. Waking up the uglyness that I never wanted to see manifested outside of me. It reminded me of the terror that I shut out within - but not for many many years to come would I own it - Of the memory of Gloria Trevi, who was once accused of sex trafficking children or at least accused of it. Who could ever do that? Who could ever do such things...to me?
 
Then, in TO when I was trying my best to get over a love like no other, as I was trying to expand my range of emotion, I searched for a psychological thriller. First came up the Playboy bunny mansion documentary, another one. After watching it, which in restrospect is quite a lineup and synchronistic connection, I came upon Mr. Robot. In the opening Episode, the main character Elliot hacks a coffee shop’s wifi, which turns out to be an underground pornography, ahem, child pornography operation. It fascinates me, torments me and reminds me of another...When I was a teen, unable to see anything remotely violent or abusive that involved nakedness, something popped up on TV. I remember the placement of the TV distinctly. It had never been there before and was never there again. A woman, lying down on her stomach, naked in the total of the shot and showed from the lower lower back up. Something in the shape of a large topspin, a trompo, which seemed to be filled with something that might be injected into her lower back with the pointer of the large spintop dropped down into her skin. I flailed and lost it. I went bizerk, shaking, running, everything around me double and in movement, hardly breathing. No one could understand why; not even me.  

Then, there was my mother’s exhusband, Ralph, who once accused me of taking his pants off while spooning with me from the back. One day, taking his clothes off in the laundry room I yelled out at my mother for help. He accused me of watching him, while menacingly shaking his belt buckle, pants hanging by his hands while his all white long mormon underwear showed under the half dressed body. My mother never ever responding in a way that would satisfy or absolve anyone. Later, that same 300lbs man took our brother out to play basketball. When they pulled up to the house, I walked towards the car. Parked mid-driveway, he leaned over toward the passenger seat, where my brother sat. Under a hunch, I slowly approached the car.  Upon reaching the driver’s side window I noticed Ralph’s hands in my little brother’s pants, rubbing my brother’s penis. I don’t recall what I said in the moment. I do remember running into the house and calling my mother, wherever she might have been and telling her what happened. She was not home. Call the police she said over the phone, and so I did. We never saw him again. I was thereafter considered bad luck, rather than someone who could smell out problems.

As I tell my story, it is starting to appear that the only problem was mine, my dilema. My mother would run as fast as she possibly could for my siblings, but not me.  
My sister once accused my cousin Mauricio of abusing her sexually. She cried in my mother’s arms until she was satisfied. Where as when I raised the alarm on the family patriarch and known sexual predator, who abused me, my sister and likely my brother along with my mother, all of my aunts and quite likely my uncles; I was questioned, distrusted, rebuffed and eventually ostracized by everyone who instead of comforting me offered penance and suspect accusations such as, "We all suffered it! You aren’t special! Get over it." I would forever be marked as the sinner who let out the family secret.

My sister who lived with my grandparents along with my brother for an entire year before I did, denied it vehemently. So it wasn’t until later that I saw a difference in the handling of things, when my sister finally admitted my grandfather had sexually abused her, too. My mother reacted with kindness and support towards her. Unveiling disastrous violence on her family who knew what was happening while she innocently worked her butt off in the US cleaning hotels and putting her picture in papers for men to call her.

I mean, nobody likes the messenger in these kinds moments. And societly, as we know, has learned to shut up people like me very effectively over the centuries. How many women suffered under monsters in hollywood and how many more under monsters in their very own home? It wasn’t until recently that it became acceptable to accuse men and rightly so, of their offenses. 

None of this makes me feel better, it really doesn’t. It raises a lot of anguish, feelings of disgust that I’d rather not touch. It raises feelings of shame, embarrassment, abandonment, loneliness, incurable sadness and depth of hate…then, of thought, of independence and resilience and a willingness to try again – much like the itsy bitsy spider, I go up the spout again. This time, however, I’ll check my toe holds, the weather and how long ago the water spout was cleaned before embarking a new journey once more. 

Then there was the time I turned on my mother’s third husband’s TV, which was in our livingroom hooked up to a VCR, remember those? I pushed play. Porn. WHAT THE FUCK??????? I screamed and was in no uncertain terms shunned again, shut up again. I must have been a teen at this time. This man was later accused of smelling young women’s dirty underwear, apparently, they belonged to a roommate we had at the time. My mother “found them in his pants pocket while doing laundry.” Who knows whose they really were or why at that time my mother decided to do something about it. While he was out of the house, she told me that he had been paying an apartment for another woman. What is true? Who knew. But they continued to see each other until his dying day. Actually, they were the roommates underwear, I remember her moving out immediately after the debacle, honoring herself and being honest about his come on’s and uncomfortable manner.

There was something different about me, about how she, my mother, handled things. And, to this day it feels as though I deserved less from her, or was not entitled to her love, her protection. Some thing makes me think it may be that she thought I was stronger than them, and that I could handle more – should handle more than anyone else or that I should live on less than anyone else.

Or was it that what she profusely apologized for was so much worse that opening the door to caring, comforting and allowing me to process would result in demise for her? For all? Except me, of course. 

I once uttered that I wanted to be a lawyer, this was after years of swearing I would be a model and I was praised for it. My mother immediately said, No, being a lawyer is dangerous. Mind you, this happened in the United States, while visiting a friend of my mother’s whose daughter who wanted to be a judge. The mother might have been a therapist, much like the other therapsits my mother befriended. They all counseled me since I was obviously severely mentally disturbed according to my mother and likely then became her friends. We would go over and visit as if we were family all the while I stood there in the middle of all of it feeling displaced, disconnected, wronged and accused in so many ways of things that I would not come to understand for a long, long time. Uncomfortable became the way I felt all the time.  Still, It wasn’t till my late teens that panic attacks, severe anxiety and insomnia took over.

Then is when my reading picked up again. I was desperate to find a solution that didn’t involve pills. I was utterly against them. Still to this day I stay away, as far away from western medicine as possible. And my insane, completely irrational fear of needles is, well, unfounded – Or so, I thought. 
My mother often quibbled and complained about how much I cried endlessly as a baby, and nothing, no one could comfort me. I cried and cried and was a terror of a child. So much so, that often she claimed to have given me Dramamine just to get me to shut up. Later, as I was growing up, she loudly and frequently complained that she could not even touch my forearms because I screamed like a banshee. That I had lymph node problems and uber sensitivity that she could not comprehend.  
I still am taken over, from time to time by the visions of many, holding me down against my will as I kick, scream in terror, horror, fear knowing what is coming and yet not knowing what is coming. My stomach constricts as I think of this, my shoulders pull forward in attempt to wall myself off from what happens in the cloudy memories. How often did it happen? Who was it? What did they do? Why did mom apologize while visibly consumed by guilt over and over and over for the things she did when I was little? What is there? What was there? "Will I ever see it?" I ask myself.  

When I decided to see what was there, on the 22nd, I walked across a parking lot after picking up groceries, veggies, fruit, things for my smoothie. I normally did not take that path home but wanted to give the dogs some off leash time and this was the way to do that. I saw a car for the first time, black, sleek with one word written on it, LUCID.  
Today, I feel I am or at least I am seeing a fuck load. Since I started writing Yoga has been incredibly impossibly difficult to do. I sit at my mat and meditate. That’s as far as I get. Now that I have been practicing yoga for a few months off and on, I am feeling a much more intimate connection with the practice, with myself. The depth hit depth. As I was preparing for my yoga this morning, which I have tried to do for the last several days by starting differently. Coffee, meditation, in the room, only breathing, one position...etc. Today, I prepared myself to see what was there, to be fully with whatever was there. I reminded myself that stuff was arising, and it was going to be there, coming up and that I could allow it, even if that meant crying between poses, pausing as necessary or laying there the whole time crying was OK as well.
